Is enrollment, this is Carlo. May help you. Hi, Carlos. My name is Stephanie TER. 0:07 Half we've spoken before. How are you good? How are things with you stuff? 0:12 Good good now that I've finished and receive the personal training certification. 0:21 I want to talk to you about the nutrition certification. 0:26 Sure, so I guess what I want to find out, mostly is a little bit about the the study when I find out how much it costs. 0:44 And just the basic details from you. 0:47 Yeah, so we have two nutrition courses, once for general nutrition designed to meal plan for all walks of life it's very comprehensive that course for our returning. 1:06 Students is for 99 and you can start it for 10 dollars a month. 1:11 We also have what's known as sports, which is more specialized for athletes. 1:17 It's attached shorter, but it still covers all your basics. 1:20 And that one's 3 99 and you can start that one for 10 dollars a month. 1:27 And if you pay in full, you can do two courses for 5 99 which would make them like, you know, 2 99 50 a piece. 1:39 So there's not overlapping content to do. 1:42 There would be because they're comprehensive in their own, right? 1:48 So there's going to be some overlap, mention tragically eruption some commonality, but they're separate in that one is designed to the general public and the other is for top performing athletes. 2:03 So you wanted to have, like a real command of the topic of nutrition and feel like you can work with athletes as well, as the general public, then if you good idea to do both, if you were interested in both make sense to do both, if it's just an extra hundred dollars, and then I would have to certification, is that right? 2:30 Yeah, and you would also earn the elite trainer title, which is nice to post on your website and it's also nice to have that certification hanging for credibility and just for your own repo and achievement, totally. 2:48 Yeah, I really think it does help people somehow, I give it a good feeling of confidence in me. 2:58 These pieces of paper. 3:01 So so in order to say, okay, so if I put it all down at once by 5 99 is that right? 3:11 Correct, correct, okay. 3:13 And you would get both of those courses or you could do either one of those and choose a unique third we have courses like yoga that's new that maybe you saw online. 3:29 But if it's primarily the topic of nutrition. 3:32 Then bearded dyspepsia stowing I definitely wanted the nutrition I mean, I probably later down the road will go for a another specialty on the fitness side. 3:45 But for now, I really just wanted to definitely have both both fitness and Christian certifications. 3:53 Sure, okay, yeah. 3:56 Do you want to do the Christian courses for 5 99 okay. 4:03 Do you have a card handy to put the charge on, because I can't retrieve the card information from the previous transaction I'm happy to hear that. 4:14 Okay, well, let me confirm some information here. 4:19 Make sure that we have everything updated you're still at 1 1 6 5 4 Plaza, America drive. 4:30 Yes, I am. Okay, and that's where we would ship the current certifications. When you complete the exam, right? 4:38 That's right, okay. 4:41 So let me put in the courses and there to complete both courses on average, those that work regularly and put in at least an hour a day, four or 5 days a week usually will finish one in about two months and those that really hunker down and put in more time, I mean it's not unusual for people to knock them out within a week, but that's an extraordinary students it's a quick learner. 5:10 And maybe a background in the topic you know, most students will take about a month and a half to two and a half months. 5:16 In between there they put in at least an hour a day. Four or 5 days a week. Did you get a whole year? 5:23 And, of course, they come equipped with eBooks through the membership site. 5:32 Hard copies of the textbooks are optional and or 30 dollars a piece you could order one or both. 5:41 If you want to add to to your order or you could just try the eBooks and see how it goes and call back later. If you want to add that. 5:48 What do you prefer to that also am I able to download those books. 5:54 I didn't even they're not in the format that's downloadable. 5:59 So you pretty much have to go to the ISS trainer on whatever electronic device and read from the ISS site it's not as user friendly because when it's a PDF, you can there's more flexibility. 6:18 You could like copy the whole document and read the chapter by chapter if you wanted to make hard. 6:24 So it doesn't have that flexibility. 6:29 But the textbooks are only 30 dollars and the college level, you know, written by professors. 6:34 If you consider, you know, college level textbook are generally over 100 dollars when you're even at the junior college level. 6:42 The they're just, yeah, you don't have to order today. 6:48 You can try the E books and then call back.
